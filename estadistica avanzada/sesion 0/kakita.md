## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to
GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and
a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

# create vectors of data for three medical patients

subject\_name &lt;- c(“John Doe”, “Jane Doe”, “Steve Graves”)
temperature &lt;- c(98.1, 98.6, 101.4) flu\_status &lt;- c(FALSE, FALSE,
TRUE)

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

![](kakita_files/figure-gfm/pressure-1.png)<!-- -->

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
